          I'm a junior studying <a href="https://eecs.berkeley.edu/">EECS at UC Berkeley</a> who gets excited about tech for social good (more on that <a href="pinned.html#intro">here</a>). I'm currently looking for summer 2020 SWE internships. My previous experience is in full-stack development with a focus on frontend development (React, Typerscript, HTML/CSS). You can reach me at alicezhao@berkeley.edu if you want to link up!

          This past summer, I was a SWE intern at <a href="https://www.datadog.com">Datadog</a> on the Dashboards team in New York. I brought two highly requested features to production that improved navigation between the core app and allowed users to import and export dashboards in JSON format. I was also chosen to demo at the AWS Summit in New York!
        </p>

        <p>
          I'll also be a project manager this semester for <a href="https://www.calblueprint.org/">Blueprint</a>, a campus organization that works with nonprofits to build thoughtful web and mobile apps for social good. I will be working with 1951 Coffee, a nonprofit that provides job training and employment to refugees. My team will be building a mobile app that allows their staff to communicate with their barista trainees and provide them with digital resources like brew guides and job opportunities.
