          I'm a junior studying <a href="https://eecs.berkeley.edu/">EECS at UC Berkeley</a> who gets excited about tech for social good (more on that <a href="pinned.html#intro">here</a>). You can reach me at alicezhao@berkeley.edu if you want to link up!

          This summer, I will be a software intern at <a href="https://www.datadog.com">Datadog</a> on the Dashboards team in New York. Hit me up with any food or show recommendations!

        <p>
          I will be a project lead this upcoming semester for <a href="https://www.calblueprint.org/">Blueprint</a>, a campus organization that works with nonprofits to build thoughtful web and mobile apps for social good.

          In my sophomore fall, my team developed an intuitive full-stack web application for <a href="https://homepointr.com/">HomePointr CIC</a> that streamlines the data exchange processes between up to 40,000 homeless individuals in Scotland and appropriate care services by storing, sorting and filtering form data — we were able to deliver a working MVP within the semester and gathered user feedback to iterate and improve on the application. In my sophomore spring, my team worked with the <a href="https://www.thearcticinstitute.org/">Arctic Institute</a> to build out Rising Tides — a web-app that matches skilled volunteers with over communities affected by climate change. Working mostly with React on the front-end, I created many of the page's components with <a href="https://tachyons.io">Tachyons</a> and custom libraries.
