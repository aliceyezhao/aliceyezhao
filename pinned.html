          <h3>What does tech for social good mean to me?</h3>
          <p>
              Hiring software engineers is getting increasingly expensive, and it's not always something that nonprofits can afford. Looking for answers, I joined the <a href="https://www.impactlabs.io/">Impact Fellowship</a> and <a href="https://apply.hackny.org/">HackNY</a> in order to meet more CS students who share my desire code with a purpose. Through these experiences, I've learned that there are nuances in nonprofit work that are often not concerns in tech. 
          </p>

          <p>
            For example, the term "disrupt" in tech has become so core to its most impactful projects â€” Uber disrupted ride-sharing, Airbnb disrupted the hospitality industry, and blockchain disrupted finance. However, one can't just go in and "disrupt" a nonprofit's workflow. The nature of social sector work is extremely sensitive and one wrong push to master could potentially harm a vulnerable population. Without stepping in someone's shoes, it's hard to know what is the right choice. Success in the social sector can't be measured by traditional engineering metrics such as efficiency or elegance of code. 
          </p>

          <p>
            It's so difficult to know what the right call is when it comes to engineering for nonprofits. How am I, a CS student from the Bay Area who never thought twice about the source of her drinking water, supposed to discern how a well in Salima should dispense its water? Sympathy can only go so far until it turns presumptuous. While tech companies with philanthropic projects are well-intentioned, over-engineering due to a lack of understanding happens too often. Bridging the knowledge gap between the social sector and tech should not look like someone who knows WordPress volunteering at a nonprofit. 
          </p>

          <p>
            The need for a partnership between tech and social good is not as one-sided as it may seem. At their core, most engineers find satisfaction from building something that makes lives easier for others. Instead of nonprofits having to scramble for a part-time software intern, I strongly believe that the tech industry can shift to accommodate and nurture the social sector.
