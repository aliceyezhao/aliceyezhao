          <h3>What does tech for social good mean to me?</h3>
          <p>
              Hiring software engineers is getting increasingly expensive, and it's not always something that nonprofits can afford. Looking for answers, I joined the <a href="https://www.impactlabs.io/">Impact Fellowship</a> and <a href="https://apply.hackny.org/">HackNY</a> in order to meet more CS students who share my desire code with a purpose. Through these experiences, I've learned that there are nuances in nonprofit work that are often not concerns in tech. 
          </p>

          <p>
            For example, the term "disrupt" in tech has become so core to its most impactful projects — Uber disrupted ride-sharing, Airbnb disrupted the hospitality industry, and blockchain disrupted finance. However, one can't just go in and "disrupt" a nonprofit's workflow. The nature of social sector work is extremely sensitive and one wrong push to master could potentially harm a vulnerable population. Without stepping in someone's shoes, it's hard to know what is the right choice. Success in the social sector can't be measured by traditional engineering metrics such as efficiency or elegance of code. 
          </p>

          <p>
            It's so difficult to know what the right call is when it comes to engineering for nonprofits. How am I, a CS student from the Bay Area who never thought twice about the source of her drinking water, supposed to discern how a well in Salima should dispense its water? Sympathy can only go so far until it turns presumptuous. While tech companies with philanthropic projects are well-intentioned, over-engineering due to a lack of understanding happens too often. Bridging the knowledge gap between the social sector and tech should not look like someone who knows WordPress volunteering at a nonprofit. 
          </p>

          <p>
            The need for a partnership between tech and social good is not as one-sided as it may seem. At their core, most engineers find satisfaction from building something that makes lives easier for others. Instead of nonprofits having to scramble for a part-time software intern, I strongly believe that the tech industry can shift to accommodate and nurture the social sector.

        <h3>How does SWE fit into banking?</h3>
            <p>During finals week of my sophomore spring semester, Goldman Sachs flew me out to New York to attend Engineering Essentials, a 4-day fellowship </p>

          <h3>My first PR at my first internship</h3>
          <p>
            I was pretty proud of this one PR I made at my first internship that I wanted it to be ready to merge into the master branch immediately! It wasn’t 100% perfect but it was functional and passed the “play around with it and nothing breaks” test. I had worked on (smaller ~ 5 people) group projects before and learned that in order merge into master, I had to be up to date with the changes on master that I’ve missed out on while I was working on my feature. What I failed to realize is that the entire frontend codebase of my company cannot be considered as a (larger ~ 500 people) group project.
          </p>
          <p>
            I did the rebase and there were little if any merge conflicts, great! The codebase was so large that I had been working in my tiny little corner of a React component that no one else was looking at anymore. I typed out my first PR with a naive confidence (another thing I did not know was that submitting a functional PR is 60% of the work, not 95% like I remembered it being). 
          </p>
          <p>
            “Create pull request” would be my final words… A few moments later I got pinged by someone on a completely unrelated team. Turns out I ended up modifying over 800 files which had automatically notified over half of the teams at the company. I might as well gotten a tattoo on my forehead saying “warning: first-time intern” on my forehead.
          </p>
          <p>
            My instincts were to copy paste the changes I made in the few files into my local notes app, delete the PR and related branch completely, make a new branch, and pretend like nothing happened. My mentor told me that people who did that just didn’t have a solid grasp of Git — and that you really should never have to do that rookie move. Thankfully version control is forgiving: `git reflog` and `git reset --hard HEAD@{x}` became my new allies that allowed me to revert my branch to before the rebase!
          </p>
          <p>
            I’ve kind of extrapolated my mentor’s mentality to “you should never have to do a dirty trick to get the result you are looking for, and finding an elegant solution will always be worth your time.” <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt">Technical debt</a> is a real thing for projects with life spans longer than a semester. There are software engineers new and old that will be trying to decipher what I’ve written — and at a bare minimum I have to leave it better than I found it.
